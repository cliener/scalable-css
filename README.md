Scalable CSS workshop materials

## Requirements

You'll need a laptop with the following installed:
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) either [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or [node](https://github.com/sass/node-sass). We won't be going deep into Sass so don't worry if that's not your thing. You will want it for the workshop at least.
* An editor that supports [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint). Don't worry about that "Consider other toolsâ€¦" bit.

## Installation instructions

1. Run `yarn` or `npm install` in the site directory to install local npm packages.
2. Run `gulp` to start the project.
